## Introduction

Using data from `dogesr` [@dogesr], we will, in this vignette, analyze a sample of the social network of Venetian noble families, the one that includes *only* marriages by nobles that became doges and, in some cases, their parents.

## Set up

```{r load}
library(dogesr)
doges.sn <- marriage.graph()
```

This will call the function that creates, from raw data, the `igraph` data structure with which we can work.

## Conclusions
